## 🚀 About Me

I am a junior full-stack developer focused on building real-world applications, not just tutorials.

I enjoy working on frontend logic and user interface behavior, while also having solid backend and database foundations.

I use AI tools to improve productivity, while always reviewing, understanding, and controlling the code I write.

My goal is to grow as a professional software developer through real projects, clean architecture, and strong problem-solving skills.
