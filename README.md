## 🚀 About Me

Software Developer (Backend-Focused) focused on building real-world applications rather than only tutorials.

I enjoy working on frontend logic and UI behavior, while also having solid backend and database foundations.

I use AI tools to improve productivity, but I always review, understand, and take full control of the code I write.

My goal is to grow as a professional software developer by building real projects, applying clean architecture, and strengthening problem-solving skills.
